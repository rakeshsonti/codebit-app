### CodeBit

### Introduction:

      Codebit is a web application where users can practice
      programming problems, data structure and algorithms.There is a
      facility of doubt session where users can ask their doubts and
      others to solve their doubts.There is a Leaderboard for competing
      with others.
      In the market there are many platforms but it is difficult to find
      appropriate questions for practice data structure and algorithms and
      programming problems. Codebit provides relevant questions that help
      to understand data structure and algorithms help students to crack
      company interviews.

### Modules:

      There are many modules in my project.

### Login module:

      This module is responsible for login .This module provides a simple
      UI for putting username and password, if the user provides the
      correct password.This module hit login endpoint at backend and check
      weather user provide correct password or not if password is correct
      it allow user to show home page otherwise show error on login page.

### SignUp module:

      This module is responsible for singup a user. Users put Name ,email
      and password if the user provides correct data then it creates an
      account for that user.

### Home:

      If the user logs in with the correct password , the user reaches the
      home page. On the home page there are multiple buttons to react to
      problems according to the data structures.

      Types of data structure:

      Array,LinkedList,Stack,Queue,Tree,Heap,Matrix,String,Searching,Sorting
      ,Recursion,and Hashing.

### Explore:

      If a user chooses a data structure then on the next page the user gets
      all the problems related to those data structures.

### NewPanel:

      Once user select a problem according to the problem user get problem part
      on this page and code Editor for writing the code, code editor comes with
      four language support eg. C,C++, Java and Python , Users can write code in
      any language.
      Users have a choice to choose their code Editor theme, font size, tab size.
      Users can reset the code and run code and submit code. If the user writes
      the correct code and users code output is according to the standard problem
      output then it will pass the test case other test cases will fail.
      Users have an option to toggle the question.If the user writes correct code
      and a test case has passed, so according to the question , points will be
      added to the users account. Points will help users to move up on the
      leaderboard.
      Users code will be saved in the database if a user comes in future for
      this problem , his code would be as it.

### Leaderboard:

      In leaderboard the module user can see his ranking and points, and will get
      on successfully problem code submissions.Leaderboard helps students to compete
      with others.

### Separate Editor: Separate Editor module has a code editor in which users can

      compile and run code in c, cpp , java and python. Code editor has lots of light
      and dark themes, font size , tab size facility.This modules for users simplicity
      so that users can practice code here.

### Ask:

      In Ask modules users can ask doubts to other people and help other people to solve
      their doubts. Doubt session is a simple one , where the user can ask doubts ,delete
      his own doubt and comment, and comment on others doubts.
